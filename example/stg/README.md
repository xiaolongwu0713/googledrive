# Feature Selection using Stochastic Gates (STG) 

[Project Page](https://runopti.github.io/stg/)|[Paper](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/5085-Paper.pdf)

Feature Selection using Stochastic Gates (STG) is a method for feature selection in neural network estimation problems. 
The new procedure is based on probabilistic relaxation of
the l0 norm of features, or the count of the number of selected features.
The proposed framework simultaneously learns either a nonlinear regression or classification function while selecting a small subset of features.

|Top: Each stochastic gate z_d is drawn from the STG approximation of the Bernoulli distribution (shown as the blue histogram on the right). Specifically, z_d is obtained by applying the hard-sigmoid function to a mean-shifted Gaussian random variable. Bottom: The z_d stochastic gate is attached to the x_d input feature, where the trainable parameter Âµ_d controls the probability of the gate being active|

## Python 

### Installation

#### Installation with pip

To install with `pip`, run the following command:
```
pip install --user stg
```

#### Installation from GitHub

You can also clone the repository and install manually:
```
git clone 
cd stg/python
python setup.py install --user
```

### Usage

Once you install the library, you can import `STG` to create a model instance:
```
from stg import STG
model = STG(task_type='regression',input_dim=X_train.shape[1], output_dim=1, hidden_dims=[500, 50, 10], activation='tanh', optimizer='SGD', learning_rate=0.1, batch_size=X_train.shape[0], feature_selection=True, sigma=0.5, lam=0.1, random_state=1, device="cpu") 

model.fit(X_train, y_train, nr_epochs=3000, valid_X=X_valid, valid_y=y_valid, print_interval=1000)
# Start training...
```

For more details, please see our Colab notebooks:
- [Regression example](https://colab.research.google.com/github/runopti/stg/blob/master/python/examples/Regression-example.ipynb)
- [Classification example](https://colab.research.google.com/github/runopti/stg/blob/master/python/examples/Classification-example.ipynb)
- [Cox example](https://colab.research.google.com/github/runopti/stg/blob/master/python/examples/Cox-example.ipynb)

## R

### Installation 

You first need to install the python package. 

#### Installation from CRAN

Run the following command in your R console:
```
install.packages("Rstg")
```

#### Installation from Github

```
git clone git://github.com/runopti/stg.git
cd stg/python
python setup.py install --user
cd ../Rstg
R CMD INSTALL .
```

### Usage

Please set the python path for `reticulate` to the python environment that you install the python stg package via this command in your R console or at the beginning of your R script. 
```
reticulate::use_python("path_to_your_python_env_with_stg")
```

Then you can instantiate a trainer:
```
stg_trainer <- stg(task_type='regression', input_dim=100L, output_dim=1L, hidden_dims = c(500,50, 10), activation='tanh', optimizer='SGD', learning_rate=0.1, batch_size=100L, feature_selection=TRUE, sigma=0.5, lam=0.1, random_state=0.1)
```

You can then fit the model to data as follows:
```
# After preparing `X_train`, `y_train`, `X_valid`, and `y_valid'
stg_trainer$fit(X_train, y_train, nr_epochs=5000L, valid_X=X_valid, valid_y=y_valid, print_interval=1000L)
```

You can save your trained model 
```
stg_trainer$save_checkpoint('r_test_model.pth')
```
and load the model
```
stg_trainer$load_checkpoint('r_test_mode.pth')
```
